BenfordAnalyses_Final.R file is the analysis pipeline used to determine if each dataset conformed to the NBL.
NBL_Analysis_TestComparisons.R is the analysis pipeline used to determine the best test to compare conformity to the NBL.
Sample_Data.csv is a sample set of randomly generated numbers for input into the pipelines. Please be aware that these data (while not tested) will likely not conform to the NBL because they are artificially generated.
